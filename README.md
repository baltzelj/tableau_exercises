## Navigation
This repository has several files associated with it. In the [tableau data](tableau data) folder, there are the following files:
- The [bike data csv](tableau data/bike_dataframe.csv) file is the concatenated data for the January, February, and March Citibike data.
- The python file [comb_df](tableau data/comb_df.ipynb) was used to concatenate the three csv files into one data frame.
- The remaining csv files were the original extracted data that was used for analysis.

The overall [Tableau workbook](Module 18 Challenge.twbx) provides a storyline analysis of the data, specifically regarding the use of electric bikes, and trends in the data pertaining to them.

## Objective and Analysis
The goal of my data analysis was to show trends of the data pertaining to electric bikes for the first three months of the 2024 year. While I was able to provide a storyline of the data for those months, and observe some interesting trends, it's important to point out that three months of data is not enough to state any significant trends. A possible way to improve this data would be to compare these same three months to other years and see if the data is a commonality from January to March. Another interesting potential analysis would be to extend the analysis to other months beyond these three.

From the data, you can see patterns that include an increase in bike use for both types of bikes as the year progresses. Another interesting data phenomenon is the preference of a bias towards electric bikes over regular bikes. However, based on the data it appears that while electric bikes are more popular, they are used primarily for short trips while classic bikes are used for longer trips.
